1. What does one need to do to use a module?

<font color= green>
One must group related code into a file with the extention ".py" to use a module. </font>

2. Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code 

<font color= green>
Random Module
import random
prob = random.random()
print("Probability ...", prob)
 </font>


3. as an example using this module.
<font color= green>
Probability ... 0.03217154321123428 </font>

1. What is a benefit of using Exception handling? 
<font color= green>
The benefits of using Exception handling is that it normally stop and generate an error message when something goes wrong.</font> 
    

1. What are the 4 components used for Python Exception Handling?
<font color= green>
The 4 components for Python exception handling is as follow:</font>  
 * try block lets you test a block of code for errors. 
    *  block lets you handle the error.
    * The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.
    * The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.


5. NumPy arrays are like what Python data types?
    * integer
    * string
    * range
    * float


1. What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays.
<font color= green>
It contains a multidimensional array and matrix data structure (in the form of rows and columns) </font>


1. What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?
<font color= green>
specify which data type you want </font>

1. Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 
    * Broadcasting
    * Mathematical Operations


1. Name one of the other libraries we'll use with NumPy?
    * Pandas


1. What is the shape of NumPy arrays?
<font color= green>
As the number of elements in each dimension are the same, use numpy.reshape() </font>

1. What is a Tensor?
<font color= green>
mathematical objects that can be used to describe physical properties </font>


1. Name a reason why it's better using NumPy for Data Analysis than using a Python List?
    * Less Memory - NumPy arrays occupy less memory as compared to list
    * Fast - NumPy arrays are fast compared to lists
    * Convenient - it is convenient to work with NumPy


1. When creating an "empty" array, where do the elements come from?
<font color= green>
 The reason to use empty() over zeros() (or something similar) is speed - just make sure to fill every element afterwards!</font>
